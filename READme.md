Project:
I have been logging my weight almost daily since 2018 and I want a nice way to plot it independent of apps and ecosystems. The biometrics are specifically to my use case but feel free to fork and edit the program to your needs.

Summary:
This program restructures an input file to a form that is more plottable.
It makes different kinds of plots with the option of saving the outputs
